# Guided Assignment 2
## Assignment
This assignment is the introduce the WPF controls
* Labels
* TextBoxes
* Buttons

You will do this by creating an application that does 3 seperate functions.

1. Create a small form that asks for the users first and last name. You then display their full name in a MessageBox. ( Revisit Guided Assignment 1 for a review on how to use a MessageBox )

2. Create a small form that asks the user for 2 numbers. The user can then choose to add or subtract the numbers. The full equation and result wil then be displayed.

3. Ask the user for a word. You will then ask them for a number and display the character located at that number 

You will also revisit previous concepts such as validating data, writing reusable code in methods, and parsing strings into numbers.
## Goal
Your goal is to become comfortable adding controls to your wpf forms, and working with lables, textboxs, and buttons in general. 

Also, you will be honing your C# skills. You will be using conditions, variables, methods, operations, outputs, and arrays. Review the Programming 1 materials in canvas to refresh on these concepts.
